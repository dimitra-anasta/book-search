![img](images/Screen%20Shot%202023-01-05%20at%2011.06.58%20PM.png)

## Description
Using starter code, with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and I had to refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. 

## Installation
Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.

Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.

Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.

Deploy your application to Heroku with a MongoDB database using MongoDB Atlas. Use the Deploy with Heroku and MongoDB Atlas walkthrough for instructions.

## Usage
This application is useful to users because it allows them to save books to read and research. It allowed me to understand the connection between the backend and frontend better. It was challenging, especially getting the backend to work in apollo.
